# Root-finding-Algorithm
Newton-Raphson, Modified Newton-Raphson, Line Search and BFGS methods

This is a simple code that allows you to calculate the root of a nonlinear equation by using one of the root-finding methods described above.
You can also enter the analytical solution for comparison purposes. 
The notation of the equations follows the book "Nonlinear Finite Element Methos" by Wriggers.
